    <h3>The Annamalaiyar Temple in Thiruvannamalai, Tamil Nadu, is a major Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva, located at the base of the Annamalai Hills. It is one of the Pancha Bhoota Sthalams (five great temples representing the elements), symbolizing fire (Agni). The temple is a massive complex, known for its towering gopurams, intricate carvings, and its spiritual significance, especially the circumambulation of the nearby Arunachala hill, known as Girivalam.</h3>
