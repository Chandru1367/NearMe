    <h3>Urgoundanur Falls in Thiruvannamalai is a tourist attraction known for its waterfalls, offering a "great water fall" experience. It is a free-to-enter location with no admission fee or tickets required. However, the area is not wheelchair accessible, and public transport is limited, making it difficult to reach beyond a certain point. </h3>
